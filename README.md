# GTA5YND2OSM
This unorganized pile of code converts the `path.xml` in `common.rpf/data/levels/gta5` to OpenStreetMap XML and scales it so it is roughly to real-world scale. It is called YND because I was initially going to convert the YND files but I found the XML file, and that is much easier to convert!

Put the file (not including it here because copyright, and it's too big) in the project folder and run the main in `Parse.java`. The .osm file will show up on your desktop.
